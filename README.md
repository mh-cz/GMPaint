# GMPaint

A painting program for demonstration as my school project for my finals. It's limited but somewhat usable

Brush, line, eraser, pipette, fill and area selection tool, layers, copy/paste with resizing and rotating, import/export and partially working undo

Made in GameMaker 2 using surfaces, buffers and shaders

You can grab some code out of it if you like something
