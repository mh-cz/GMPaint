# GMPaint

A painting program for demonstration as my school project for my finals. It's limited but somewhat usable

Brush, line, eraser, pipette, fill and area selection tool + layers, copy/paste with resizing and rotating, import/export and partially working undo

All of this is 100% made in GameMaker 2 using surfaces, buffers and shaders
